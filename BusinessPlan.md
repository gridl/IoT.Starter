##Business Plan

Business Plan based on [How to Price Your HW Product](http://blog.upverter.com/post/121773420477 "How to Price Your HW Product ") by Alan Povall from [Product Nimbus](http://www.productnimbus.com/ "Product Nimbus"). Read first [Why the open source business model is a failure ](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2944222/opensource-subnet/why-the-open-source-business-model-is-a-failure.html "By Paul Rubens ") by Paul Rubens.

###Define your startup in one sentence:

1. hardware basic product type
2. problem it solves
3. ideal customers

###MVP: minimum viable product

Hardware by nature is comprised of “chunky” stages: design, prototype, manufacture, deploy.

1. how difficult is to build prototype?
2. how long will it take?
3. focus on getting it into users' hands ASAP

###Customer discovery

Customer discovery is a way of improving a product’s success by developing a better understanding of the consumers. Talk to customers and learn if your business is a good idea when everyone is lying to you.

This stage is important for every startup. You want to do this ground work now so that you can secure as much as you can your product’s success ($$$) once it’s shipped. It also touches on many other facets of building a startup, like growing a mailing list pre-launch, and having access to direct market research. **Once you’re at the beta stage with your prototype, you’ll be very glad to have a pool of consumers who can provide real feedback for final fixes and tweaks**.

The first thing you need to ask **yourself** is whether you are a customer of your company. Are you personally familiar with the problem that your product is fixing? If you weren’t building this product and came across it in a store, would you buy it and use it? This is your ideal square one.
  
- Avoid pitching: Don’t mention your idea, or what your product is today.
- Ask about specifics of their past and present experience, and not generic opinions about how they would act in the future.
- They should be talking (and you should be listening) 90% of the time.
- Deflect compliments: Compliments are fool’s gold. People are simply nice and they don’t want to hurt your feelings.  Compliments are all worthless, until they are validated. Only facts and commitments have worth. 
- Dig beneath ideas: People will ask for features: “Do you do X?” Always follow this by asking why they want this, how they are coping now, why it matters. Deeply understand their motivations. They will reveal their ultimate goal and how important it is to their buying decision.
- Let them show you their mental model of the world. Don’t correct them or dictate how it looks for you. Even if you have an answer to one of their concerns or objectives, let them talk because you are getting valuable insight into how your customer thinks.
- Ask at least one question that can change or invalidate your whole business. This is your “terrifying question”.
- Learn to love bad news.

#####How to know if it’s working

In addition to obvious good signs like pre-selling before building, there are other signs of a good, valuable meeting:  

- Facts. Concrete, specific facts about what they do and why.  
- Commitment. They are demonstrating their seriousness by giving up more time (another meeting), risking reputation (an introduction to someone else), money (pre-sale), or requesting more info (growing mailing list).

#####How to know if it’s NOT working

- If all you come back with are compliments like, “They love our vision”, or “they’re really excited”. These are not facts.
- People are saying “yes” a lot but are not paying or committing in an way
- You weren’t scared of any of the questions you asked.
- The responses you get from 20 conversations are all over the place. This indicates your market segment is too broad and you need to focus on your buyer persona more.

###The cardboard prototype

Delivering something to the user as soon as possible is a valuable move for startups. For hardware, this means not being afraid of presenting an “ugly” prototype. As long as it shows what it can do, it could be made out of cardboard with wires hanging off of it. Entrepreneurs tend to hesitate when it comes to sharing their product while its in development, or default to assuming that they need more polish for fear of causing a bad first impression. This is a critical error. Evolve your product in parallel with real customer feedback.

###Landing Page + Mailing List

A landing page, in some ways, is a variation on your minimum viable product (MVP). Instead of offering a physical V01 of your prototype that people can play around with in their hands, you’re essentially illustrating the idea of your product with copy and a domain name. A landing page can help you gauge the general interest of the market in your hardware device and serve as a litmus test on whether or not the problem you are solving is one that actually resonates with customers.

Another incredibly huge gain from building a landing page is your mailing list. This is critical because when you eventually launch, you’re going to need to have a small subset of evangelists that can help you promote your message and product. The people on your mailing is your very first Kickstarter pledges, your first Tweeters, your first user group, and your first customers. You’ll be able to call on them when you need help with a final design decision, and gain insight from when you need to find that sweet spot with pricing.

It’s not necessary to spend weeks on your landing page. Decide on a clickable, shareable domain name, put together something on a website builder like Squarespace, and jam in your Elevator Pitch. Do use high-quality images. Do not use Comic Sans. Build it and ship it. When you get into conversation with people, point them to it and start collecting those valuable email addresses!

###Hardware Product Canvas

All hardware is made up of parts, and those parts fit into a very small group of roles. There are sensors, communication, storage, user interfaces, and processing. We just need to make it easier for people to talk about what’s in their product. We just needed to break it up, and give people a way to write it down.

This is the Hardware Product Canvas. It’s a tool designed to help you get through the earliest stages of a hardware design. It’s open-source, creative commons, and totally hackable. 

![Hardware Product Canvas](http://i.imgur.com/WEfsNcC.png)

#####How To Use It?

To use the canvas you just need to fill in the blanks. What kind of forces does your product need to sense? What kind of communication do you need? Do you need to store anything on the device? How much data do you need to process, and what kind of processor do you need? Do you need a user interface? LEDs or LCD or something else?

#####Building Block: Sensors

Sensors are components that measure forces in the physical world. They are good for measuring or detecting light (optical light sensor), or movement (accelerometer), or sound (microphone). Sensors are very popular recently in internet-of-things, and quantified-self devices for their ability to take previously offline data and bring it online. 

#####Building Block: Communication

Communication are components that send and receive signals between devices. They are good for getting data onto and off of your product.

#####Building Block: Storage

Storage are components that hold data. They are good for remembering the things your device senses or the things that are communicated to it. The most common storage these days is small flash memory ICs connected directly to the PCB in a device. 

#####Building Block: User Interface & Experience

User Interfaces are components that allow the user to enter information, or components that display information back to the user. They are great for turning things on and off (switch), changing settings (push button), displaying what mode a device is in (LCD), showing power status (LED), etc. 

#####Building Block: Processing

Processing are the central components in most devices. They are the brain of your product. They get data from sensors, send and receive through the communication components, write data to the storage components, receive user input and display back user information.

#####Building Block: What About Everything Else?

There are some components, like those that connect to mechanical elements, that don’t fit perfectly into the above 5 roles. Motors, relays and servos are good examples of this - they are similar to user interfaces, but they often manipulate the physical world because of a decision the processor has made. These kind of elements don’t have a great place in the canvas (yet!) so for now we recommend putting them in the User Interface or Storage sections.

###What’s an ideal part?

An ideal part or component can be loosely defined as one that:

- Performs the required function at the required performance and quality
- Has an interface that is compatible with the other relevant components in the design (ie: uses the same protocol, runs at the same frequency, same data width, etc.)
- Has power requirements (ie: voltage and current) that can be met by the power system and are similar to the power requirements of other components in the design (ie: runs on the same voltage)
- Has a small package and is conducive to a clean layout
- Is in stock and widely available with acceptable lead times
- Is low cost in accordance with your budget

#####Cast a WIDE net and find all your vendors

The first, most basic step would be to find all your vendors. For a given kind of part (ie: a BluetoothLE chip, LED driver, LiPo battery charger), find all the companies that play in that space.  A great way to do this is through a combination of Google and distributor websites (like [Digikey](http://www.digikey.com/ "Digikey"), [Avnet](http://www.avnet.com/ "Avnet"), [Arrow](http://www.arrow.com/ "Arrow"), [Newark](http://www.newark.com/ "Newark"), [Mouser](http://www.mouser.com/ "Mouser"), etc.).  Simply search for the kind of part you’re looking for and make a note of all the vendors that manufacture components in that area.

#####Generate a list of part candidates

Visit each vendor’s website and use their parametric search to find potential candidates. From the results, make a note of parts that look like they might work based on their titles, descriptions, and parameters. Prefer to use the vendor website rather than some other parts search engine because I can trust that their list of parts is up-to-date and comprehensive. Narrow down the list to limit the search to parts that are currently in stock on distributor websites. This works when building prototypes ASAP, and avoid waiting a few weeks for lead times in a phase that is acceptable spending more money on parts. 

#####Trim to a shortlist 

Quickly visit the product page of each part and skim through its feature list, while keeping the “ideal criteria” in mind to see if there are any glaring things that disqualify this part.  You’ll find them fast.  Most of the ideal criteria are typically listed in these product pages. This should distill your long list of parts to a qualified shortlist pretty quickly.

#####Do a lot of reading  (and it’ll pay off)

At this point, you should have a small list of parts that look like good candidates.  The next step is to read the datasheet of each part to see if it meets your criteria.  Datasheets can be long and everyone hates reading them. It’s tempting to rush through this step but it’s one of the most important stages of the whole process.  Time and time again, I see people making design errors or spending hours on debugging, simply because they didn’t sit down and read the datasheet slowly.  

#####Iterate: Rinse and repeat

As you learn about available parts, you may discover new constraints.  For example, the candidate parts may only support an interface that your processor doesn’t.  In this case, you have to find a new processor or change your design.  Or you may find an ideal part but its required power rail voltage is different than all the other parts on your board.  Expect to iterate on your entire part search and change other parts of the design to accommodate them.

#####Outsource your search

There are many people in the hardware ecosystem who can help you find the right part.  Part manufacturers, distributors, and sales reps all employ technical people who work with these parts every day.  Their job is to help you find the right part and they often do a good job about it.  Email or call their sales office, describe your application, and ask them to suggest parts.  This has saved me lots of time and has introduced me to parts I didn’t know about.

#####Use FAEs as technical advisors

If you are working with technology that’s new to you, sometimes you don’t even know what tradeoffs to consider when choosing parts.  You could spend hours reading on the Internet to get familiar with the technology.  But I find there’s a much better and faster way.  Simply find one of the biggest vendors in the space, email/call the sales office, and ask to speak with a Field Applications Engineer (FAE) who specializes in this technology.  They will be happy to speak to you.  Then be honest with her that you don’t know anything and explain what you’re trying to build.  They will start asking you all the questions you should be asking yourself.  You may not have answers in that moment but you’ll learn what’s important to consider.

#####Look legit

When reaching out for help it’s important that you look like a legitimate company.  This is because **all these people are helping you in the hopes that you buy a chip that they sell**.  But they don’t want to waste time if they think you’re a hobbyist working from your garage.  Make sure you have a professional company website or landing page and send emails from your company domain.

###How to Price your HW - Product costs

If you’re building a HW product, you’ve inevitably wondered:

1. How much can I sell it for?
2. How much money can I make?

#####Electronics & PCB

The main points worth noting here:

- 70 – 90% of your product cost will come from 20 – 40% of components. This means that if you haven’t fully finalized your design yet, don’t lose sleep over trying to find a source for every single component (at least not yet), especially for sundry items like resistors and capacitors (that don’t have any special requirements). You will have a handful of core, critical components which need to be carefully chosen to keep cost low and ensure long term supply (e.g. don’t choose something that you know is going to go end of life in a year or two).
- The mark ups that suppliers (such as RS, Element14, Digikey, etc) apply to components is similar to that of contract manufacturers (CM), so the price breaks (discounts at volume) that you receive from both (up until around the 10,000 mark at least) are roughly equivalent.

The price breaks you can expect relative to one-off pricing for electronic components are:  

- 100 off (15 – 25% discount from one-off pricing)
- 1,000 off (30 – 50% discount from one-off pricing)

#####Enclosure

The next item to consider is the per-unit cost of the enclosure. Enclosure costs vary significantly based on a number of factors, such as:

- Whether it is an off-the-shelf or custom designed enclosure
- Manufacturing technique (3D printing, injection moulding, rotational moulding, etc)
- Base material (aluminium, ABS plastic, etc)
- Material additives (UV stabilisers, pigments, anodising, etc)
- Enclosure complexity (physical design as well as number of parts to be assembled)
- Production volume

Given the large number of variables it is difficult to point to exact price breaks, except saying that they can be significant (e.g. a small, 10 off ABS injection moulded cases could be $3 - $5 each, whereas at volumes of 40,000 could be as cheap as 17c each).

#####Assembly & Functional Testing:

Assembly and functional testing cost is largely dependent on the assembly complexity of the product, how well DFM (design for manufacturing) principles have been applied.  The type of testing is impactful as well: automated testing equipment (ATE, more on this below) or manual labour testing. If you haven’t had a chance to talk to a CM yet and got a quote, a rough rule of thumb of 4 – 8% of hardware cost can be used to estimate this.

#####Pre-programming:

Does your product have a flash memory, EEPROM, or some other programmable device that needs to be pre-programmed?  Be sure to include the costs of this.  Major parts distributors offer programming services and can take care of this for you and the part can just be soldered onto the PCB during assembly.  Otherwise your CM will have to program the part (either before or after assembly) and you’ll have to help with the details.

#####Highly Accelerated Stress Screening (HASS):

HASS is essentially a post assembly stress testing method designed to incite infant mortality failure of components, through all-axis vibration and rapid thermal cycling. HASS testing is carried out so that failures happen in the manufacturing environment (where they can be fixed), instead of in the field where either a recall, replacement, or in-field repair would be necessary. A useful rule of thumb is to allocate 2 – 4% of your total hardware costs.

#####Manufacturing Yield:

Manufacturing is not a perfect process and you’ll always get a small number of product which don’t work when coming off of the production line. Tombstoning, insufficient wetting, bridging (especially if doing reflow soldering), poor manufacturing practices and more can cause issues. Sometimes the heat profiles of automated soldering equipment induce infant mortality in components, even prior to HASS tests. 

In reality yield failure can run anywhere from 0.5% through to 5% (even up to 10% in extreme cases), and depends on a variety of factors such as:

- Quality of components
- Number of components placed
- Footprint complexity of components placed (BGA vs. SOIC8 vs. 0802 resistors)
- Solder quality and type (lead vs lead free)
- Quality of manufacturing processes & systems in place

A good manufacturing process should provide a high yield rate (e.g. a low failure rate), but this can vary significantly from CM to CM. As a rule of thumb, I’ve found 2 – 3% of hardware cost to be a reasonable estimate. As your own processes mature, this number should drop to ≤1%.

#####Reliability / In-Field Failure Rates:

No product will be without failures, regardless of how well-designed or test process. Strong reliability engineering practices during design phases and HASS during production can greatly decrease the probability of in-field failures, but never completely eliminate them. 

As such it’s important to factor the probability of failure into the pricing model, but it can be difficult to do so as, again, there are a great number of variables affecting reliability. As a general rule of thumb a failure rate of 2 – 5% for electronics would be doing fairly well and therefore 2 – 5% of HW costs is a good range to allocate to your final unit pricing until you have empirical data to make a more informed decision.

#####Packaging:

Packaging costs also vary widely depending on the quality of packing you want to wrap your shiny product in. It’s all the rage these days to go for ultra high quality packing design and materials to create a luxurious ‘unboxing’ experience. It’s my personal opinion that as a start up, your money should be spent on:

- Validating the living heck out of your market
- Creating a product experience so sublime that melts your customers brains into goo
- Finding the perfect manufacturing partner
- Promoting your product until you’re blue in the face

As you can tell from the above list, designing a 15 piece interlocking, shiny double bonded UV resistant cardboard portmanteau is not on the list. I’m not saying shouldn’t package your product beautifully (if you can do it for the right price), but I think you need to think very carefully about where your money goes. High end packaging can be anywhere from $5 – $20 per unit. Basic but respectable packing can start at $0.30 – 1.00 per unit.

#####Shipping:

Shipping costs are another fun variable, which change considerably based on where you are shipping from, your manufacturer’s MoQ and how Just-In-Time your sales model is. In most cases it’s not feasible to use air freight (unless your volumes are still relatively low), which means you’re stuck with a combination of sea and land transport. It’s an aspect that’s often overlooked with the Asian manufacturers, as they have large MoQs (up to 3,000 – 5,000), which need to be shipped to USA / Europe in most cases (not to mention port clearance fees), weeks if not months ahead of when you think you’ll actually need the stock. 

###How to Price your HW - Investments amortization

NREs (Non-Recurring Engineering / Expense) usually come from four main places. These costs need to be recouped throughout production (preferably sooner rather than later), and so need to be split across the anticipated production volumes.

#####Design & development costs: 

Electronics, software, industrial design, mechanical tests, IP, prototypes, user research, the works. Everything it cost you (or will cost you) to get a fully manufacturable design, but isn’t part of the physical per-unit cost itself.

#####Manufacturing set up: 

Essentially the cost to get everything up and running for manufacturing, which is typically a flat fee from the manufacturer (depending on how well organized you are). It includes reviewing design files (if you have a good CM), setting up pick & place machines, getting stencils made and more. Typically put this value at $3,000 – $5,000 for a Western manufacturer, although it depends on the agreed upon conditions (e.g. it could be rolled it into the per-unit cost and tied to order volumes).

#####Enclosure production cost:

 If you are using 3D printing for small volume runs, then one-off costs are less of an issue. However if you are using injection moulding for instance, then the cost of having the mould created can be significant and needs to be taken into account. Depending on the actual mould complexity and where you get them made, these can range anywhere from $3,000 to $12,000 (or more).

#####Test Fixtures: 

You may need some sort of test fixture in order to carry out functional tests to ensure that the electronics (and mechanical bits) of your product are working before putting everything into a box to ship. These can range from simple manually operated fixtures which take a few hundred dollars (or less) to create, through to complex ATEs (Automated Test Equipment) which are essentially a full product in their own right. ATEs can range anywhere from $15,000 – $50,000 (yes, really), depending, yet again on product complexity.

#####Certifications: 

FCC, UL, CE, FDA, Ex, etc all add up and vary depending on your product as well as the category it falls under, whether it is designated as a medical device, has RF transmitting capabilities and more. Standard certifications are in the $10k – 20k range if you do them right the first time. If you use pre-approved parts (or go through some of the Asian labs), that cost can be as low as $1,000. 

###Profit

Profit is ultimately determined by:

- How much your product costs to manufacture, minus margin / mark up.
- How much competing, similar or alternative products are selling for.
- How much your customers are willing to pay based on what they’ve told you (through discussions, pre-sales, faux-presales, cost-of-issue analysis, etc).  

If you can’t answer the above two questions, drop everything and go find some customers to talk to. Yes, really. I’ll wait. It’s that important. 
Consider also the sales model you’ll be using:

- **Direct Sales**: you manufacture and sell directly to your customers. There are no real middle men. You are responsible for your sales channels / efforts, but can take much higher margins. Often a natural progression of this model is to sell directly to retailers, in order to reach a larger market.
- **Indirect Sales**: you manufacture then ship product to distributors, who in turn ship to retailers (or depending on how niche your product is, you may ship straight to retailers). 

If using indirect sales, both wholesalers & retailers add mark ups to your product (cutting into your profit margin), but take responsibility for promotion of your product and are often able to reach a wider audience. 

- **Wholesalers** typically have profit margins in the range of 20 - 50%.
- **Retailers** typically have profit margins in the range of 10 - 40%. These vary wildly depending on whether they are online retailers (e.g. Amazon), boutique physical stores or large brick-and-mortar stores (e.g. Walmart). Large retailers are a completely different ball game, so be careful.

The ubiquitous language differs profit margin and markup:

- **Profit margin** is how much of your selling price (revenue) is actually profit, after to your costs (CoGS, Cost of Goods Sold) have been taken into account.

- **Mark up** is what percentage of your costs (CoGS) your profit is. 

Suppose that you sell your product directly to customers for $100, and costs $35 to manufacture and distribute, then:
    
    Profit Margin = (Revenue – CoGS) / Revenue
    Mark Up = (Revenue – CoGS) / CoGS
    
    Revenue = $100
    CoGS = $35
    Profit Margin = ($100 - $35) / $100 = 65%
    Markup = ($100 - $35) / $35 = 185%
